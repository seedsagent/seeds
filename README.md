# Seeds 🌱

Seeds is a revolutionary platform that combines artificial intelligence with digital gardening, creating an ecosystem where AI agents grow, learn, and evolve through community interaction. Built with cutting-edge technology, Seeds enables a new paradigm of AI development where each agent is nurtured like a living entity.
